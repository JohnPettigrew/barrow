# Barrow

This is a DragonRuby dungeon-crawler with dynamic map generation and an unusual game mechanic. You will need your own copy of DragonRuby to compile this project. Place the `/mygame/` directory into a clean project, replacing the existing `/mygame` directory, and run `./dragonruby`.

Once I'm happy that it's vaguely usable, I may release binaries!
